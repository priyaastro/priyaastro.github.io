								My research bridges two powerful realms of modern astrophysics – X-ray and infrared observations – harnessing multi-wavelength synergies to probe the Universe's most extreme phenomena and their impact on cosmic evolution. Both fields are at thrilling junctures: with the XRISM X-ray observatory now operational, we’re set to reveal the Universe's most energetic processes in unprecedented detail (I'm part of the XRISM team). Meanwhile, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unlocking transformative insights into the early Universe.

								<h3 class="major">X-ray</h3>
								<p class="pa1">
								I study X-ray binaries using XRISM, Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE space-based observatories. X-ray binaries are a fascinating class of objects composed of a compact object, such as neutron star or black hole, and a companion star. The matter from the companion star is pulled towards the compact object due to its strong gravitational field. This infalling material forms an accretion disk around the compact object, heating up to extreme temperatures and emitting X-rays. The intense X-ray radiation from these systems provides valuable insights into extreme gravitational and magnetic fields, as well as the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.

								<p class="pa1">
								Early galaxies, formed within the first billion years after the Big Bang, provide a window into the infancy of the Universe. These galaxies, with their intense star formation and evolving structures, were key in shaping the cosmic landscape that we see today. I analyze James Webb's data to uncover the origins, evolution, and chemical compositions of early galaxies. Understanding early galaxies sheds light on the reionization period, a pivotal era when the Universe transitioned from darkness to light, helping us piece together the timeline of cosmic evolution.</p>

								<blockquote>
								  Priyanka was an awesome TA! When I was able to speak with her one-on-one she was sooooo helpful and wanted me succeed. Allowed us to ask questions and for help. She took her time to answer questions. Always friendly and eager to help. She always helped with questions and was able to provide feedback on labs as we were doing them. Very helpful in assisting us navigate the sometimes daunting lab setups. <cite>[Physics 213, Fall 2017]</cite>
								</blockquote>
								  
								<br>
								<blockquote>
								  She was very helpful and graded fairly. She made herself available to answer questions and was very respectful of students. She was always ready to help and very clear with instructions. <cite>[Physics 211, Fall 2018]</cite>
								</blockquote>

								<br>
								<blockquote>
								  She was there to help when needed and was very patient. She made sure that the important equations and reasons were on the board for the students to access. Helped us not flounder around looking for answers in the wrong places or if we were missing information. <cite>[Physics 241, Fall 2019]</cite>

								For me, service naturally extends beyond the classroom. By giving public lectures, making media appearances, reviewing work and supporting underprivileged students, I see service as a way to inspire growth, share knowledge, and create opportunities for those who might otherwise be left behind.

							<p class="pa1">
								My highest form of service has always been my students, as a supervisor, and as a teacher. This dedication shapes each project I devise, every lecture I prepare, every paper I grade, and every piece of advice I offer. Through each interaction, I strive to inspire and guide, firmly believing that my students' achievements are the truest measure of my service.
